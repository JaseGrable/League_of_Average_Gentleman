Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

- The goal of this project is to create a web/mobile application that will serve as a league website for a fantasy football league. This website will show standings, "power ranking," draft history, and transaction history. Currently much of this data is within the app but either buried or not searchable. I would like my application to make this information searchable by team, player, or season.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Pull trade history from the API and make it searchable per team, player, or season. Potentially add voting by league members for a "Win/Loss" verdict of past trades.
- Use API to pull in draft data from previous years. Make drafts searchable by player, team, or season.
- Create algorithm to determine power rankings or hot streaks.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Sleeper API
- React
-

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- WebScrape KTC (KeepTradeCut.com) for player values
- Build out mobile app functionality
-

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Python for webscraping? Javascript? Will research more.
- React Native/Ionic
-

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- None as of now.
