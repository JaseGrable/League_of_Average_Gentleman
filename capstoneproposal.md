Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

- The goal of this project is to create a web/mobile application that will serve as a league website for a fantasy football league. This website will show standings, "power ranking," draft history, and transaction history. Currently much of this data is within the sleeper app but either buried within multiple menus or not searchable. I would like my application to make this information searchable by team, player, or season. The application will also add league voting for "best draft/worst draft," "Winner/Loser" of historical trades, and will track both the champion and worst record for each season.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Pull trade history from the API and make it searchable per team, player, or season. Potentially add voting by league members for a "Win/Loss" verdict of past trades.
- Use API to pull in draft data from previous years. Make drafts searchable by player, team, or season.
- Create algorithm to determine power rankings or hot streaks.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Sleeper API - will determine endpoints to pull data from Sleeper Fantasy Football application. Will need to continue to read documentation to see what is all possible.
- React for front end
- Python for backend
- Firebase

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- WebScrape KTC (KeepTradeCut.com) for player values
- Build out mobile app functionality
- Add indicators of starters and best flex options based on KTC Values.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Python for webscraping? Javascript? Will research more.
- React Native/Ionic

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- None as of now.
