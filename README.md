# League of Average Gentlemen

#### An in progress website for my fantasy football league.

#### By Jase Grable

## Technologies Used

- Git
- JavaScript
- React
- HTML & CSS

## Description

This is a React web application. We are a group of friends (and Jordan) who believe like many others in America, that we are football experts. In fact, we may just be average fans. This application was inspired by dynasty-daddy.com. I wanted to make a league website that utilizes the Sleeper API app, as well as scrapes Keep Trade Cut Values from the web.

This information will likely not make any of us better at fantasy football, but it will give me something other to blame than myself. Stupid Stats, they lie.
I am using this project to work on my full stack skills and will likely add additional functionality in the future.

<summary>Available Scripts</summary>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
