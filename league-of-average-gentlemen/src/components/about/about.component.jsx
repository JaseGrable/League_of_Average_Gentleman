            <p>We are a group of friends (and Jordan) who believe like many others in America, that we are football experts. In fact, we may just be average fans. </p>
            <p>This application was inspired by dynasty-daddy.com. I wanted to make a league website that utilizes the Sleeper API app, as well as scrapes Keep Trade Cut Values from the web.</p>
            <p>This information will likely not make any of us better at fantasy football, but it will give me something other to blame than myself. Stupid Stats, they lie.</p>
